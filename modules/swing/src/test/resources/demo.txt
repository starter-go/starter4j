Package template implements data-driven templates for generating textual output.

To generate HTML output, see html/template, which has the same interface as this package but automatically secures HTML output against certain attacks.

Templates are executed by applying them to a data structure. Annotations in the template refer to elements of the data structure (typically a field of a struct or a key in a map) to control execution and derive values to be displayed. Execution of the template walks the structure and sets the cursor, represented by a period '.' and called "dot", to the value at the current location in the structure as execution proceeds.

The input text for a template is UTF-8-encoded text in any format. "Actions"--data evaluations or control structures--are delimited by "{{" and "}}"; all text outside actions is copied to the output unchanged.

Once parsed, a template may be executed safely in parallel, although if parallel executions share a Writer the output may be interleaved.

Here is a trivial example that prints "17 items are made of wool".
